# jetpacker
An easy-to-use interface that helps you generate JAVA environment toolkit.

### Getting started

The following npm packages will need to be installed globally:

1. webpack

Global modules can be installed as follows:

```
> npm install -g webpack
```

### Local npm installation

```
> cd jetpacker
> npm install
```

This will install the local dependencies.
After this has finished you will need to bind the local installation of ts-loader to the global install of typescript:

```
> npm start
```

Running `npm start` will run a local server.
